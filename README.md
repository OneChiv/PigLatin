# PigLatin
A simple one-word Pig Latin translator, written in Java.

While learning Java, I was given the assignment of creating a one word pig latin translator. I'm posting the project here as a way of tracking my progress as I learn.
In most cases, this code will be extremely impractical. But, it was fun to make and maybe you've receieved a similar task and would like to know how I did it.
Just to learn even further, I made the program a GUI and posted it on a web server. You can see that here. 

Enjoy!
